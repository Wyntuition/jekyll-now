## ASAP




- jenkins   
        - catch error and fail
        - env vars not getting set for post step? Get from env files only? Run source env for all steps?

    - halt ETL on failure
    - EVENT_LOG - get dump from PG (DMS moving?);

## TIMELY

    - any other logs/metrics we need for ETL job?
    - DMS in pipeline?
        - DMS always run in master/etc in pipeline (FIRST: be able to point pipeline to perf/unstable)

    - using hangs
    +lrg perf/dms/error trp/stories/etc

    

    [+LIST- RELEASE PLANNING
        - Review stories by epic ensuring understanding and we're not missing anything
        - Prioritize backlog with general timeline & t-shirt sizing
        - Group together source & transform stories to be worked on at the same time

        ○ our understanding of end to end
        ○ How much work is left, how long will it take
        ○ Do we need to assist
