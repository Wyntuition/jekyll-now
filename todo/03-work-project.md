# TODO: Work Proj, 12/28/17

## TODAY

    - [p] invite people to Docker demo
    - sch check-ins; update agenda/q list
    - xpert plan

## TIMELY

    - DMS in pipeline?
    

    - pipeline_ schema vs master_ on nonprod
    - DMS always run in master/etc in pipeline (FIRST: be able to point pipeline to perf/unstable)

    - final config tweaks actuyally running tests in branches? Merge. 
    - +notifications, other *'s in jemkins notes below
    - testing.sh env shrink too?
    
    - remove mapping prod
    - Jenkins updates
        - limit to 1 job at a time, or use containers wihtin branch on all but a specific branch? Multiple merges to  master could conflict.
        - research docker pipeine plug / moving docker calls in Jenkinsfile to sh's; compose in jenkins w/env vars
    - using hangs

    [+LIST- RELEASE PLANNING
        - Review stories by epic ensuring understanding and we're not missing anything
        - Prioritize backlog with general timeline & t-shirt sizing
        - Group together source & transform stories to be worked on at the same time



    - [W] Plan for VQ: meet with Lisa then team for what steps to take. Jon there, or meeting specifically to review views for 
        ○ our understanding of end to end
        ○ How much work is left, how long will it take
        ○ Do we need to assist
        - SAVE work coming in Jan

    
    
    
    ### ETL NEXT STEPS -
        -+start seeing feasibility from running full transformations - actually convert legacy cases into mod. Views 2nd priority.
        -+scope?! End of Dec for Mod schema, then more from gap analysis. In-app reports priority for views. Find major diff b/t mod and leg.
        -*TOP PRI:ESTIMATE FOR THESE: 
            1. Test app, find out what we don't know about making it prod ready. % case failure; case closure reason code error. 
            2. pri, in app reporting.
            -?* EV team have end-to-end app tests?
