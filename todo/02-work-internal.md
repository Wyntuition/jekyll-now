                - Communicate details of status a bit more, don't assume people just know things or that it would be just as fast to become aware over you telling. Communicate ideas a bit more before starting an initiative. People may have insights that help at that time, and it also fosters buy-in among the team members.
                - Diplomacy over calling out often works better when leading. Touchy responses can cause people to approch less.
