        - FB
            - J
                - Communicate details of status a bit more, don't assume people just know things or that it would be just as fast to become aware over you telling. Communicate ideas a bit more before starting an initiative. People may have insights that help at that time, and it also fosters buy-in among the team members.
                - Diplomacy over calling out often works better when leading. Touchy responses can cause people to approch less.

## xpert meeting notes


xpert notes:

- xpert agenda send out, discussions with themes (i.e. 6 month plan, upcoming themes & trends, personal project)
    - Clear outcomes.
        - Review our progress
        - Share our work in progress & ideas for upcoming work
        - Review SDSA trello
        - Review industry trends and Excella initiatives and how we can align

        QUARTERLY:
        - Brainstorm ideas: start with current trends, brainstorm projects/xpert work to do around them. Vote/etc.
        

        - 6 month plan, tie our own plans to overall xpert plan/Excella goal
            - Current business - get feedback. Collaboration. Updates from what paths people are going on? Balance b/t indiv. projects & collaboration. Review Excella initiatives, do we need to pick up anything?
            - SDSA tasks?
        - Should we meet monthly, ad-hoc?
        - Align Trends
            - Example: microservices workshop idea, how to get into AI?
        - Ideas for collaborating around projects? Tech issues across xperts to collaborate on? Assignments for xperts, come up with a few projects? Where op for growth in different services areas, by xpert?

- Check xpert mtg notes from fadi
        - Come up with xpert vision, plan, agenda
            - VISION:
                    - Keep pulse and discuss and list tech trends
                    - Keep pulse on major focuses of Excella. Marry with tech trends.
                    - Personal focus - share our goals, initiatives, ask for feedback. Share approaches planned/doing, ask for feedback.
            - GENERAL AGENDA:
                    - Lightning talk on trends. PURPOSE: Everyone on the same page on broad trends.
                    - Go over the SDSA trello, look at our tasks, look at other tasks that xperts might tackle. PURPOSE: are we covering things Excella needs from xPerts?
                    - Each share their goals, current and planned initatives, and approaches. Feedback. Collaboration? PURPOSE: Get constructive feedback and open opportunities to collaborate (edited)
                    - WORKING SESSION?
                    - PURPOSE: xpert collaboration, aligning with Excella goals, keeping up with trends, keeping Fadi updated, working sessions
                        - I have seen many examples of meetings in person being more productive than remote, whiteboarding, talking etc. 
                        - keeping pulse: we do have inputs, such as Jeff's slide. CMS - absolutely we could influence that. 
                        - People absolutely want and should get more fb
                        - the group will totally influence the meeting as well, this is just a starting point.
                        - Excella wants more collab and tasks completed to completion from experts. Have they articulated it? That's our job to do from the overall Excella goals (i.e. cloud, containers)
                        - it would be so much easier and take less effort (other than commuting) to discuss, review and clarify Excella's goals, and align ourselves to it. Then brainstorm potential projects.
                            - "Xpert hackathon" -- a mandatory "happy hour" or dinner event where we set aside dedicated time to be in the same room working toward the SDSA objectives to ensure they get accomplishe
                        - Collab - not black or white; sometimes collab sometimes solo. Sometimes it makes sense to collab more than we do.
