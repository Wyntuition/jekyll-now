### Talks

* Container Orchestration Talk

In deploying apps that have been containerized, you have a lot to think about regarding what to use in production. There are a lot of things to manage, so orchestrators become a huge help. providing many services together such as scheduling, container communication, scaling, health, and more. There are major platforms to consider from Kubernetes, Swarm to ECS. In this talk we'll go through the overview of orchestrators and some of the differences between the big players. You should come out of the talk knowing where to go next in determining your orchestrator needs.

        QUARTERLY:
        - Brainstorm ideas: start with current trends, brainstorm projects/xpert work to do around them. Vote/etc.
        

        - 6 month plan, tie our own plans to overall xpert plan/Excella goal
            - Current business - get feedback. Collaboration. Updates from what paths people are going on? Balance b/t indiv. projects & collaboration. Review Excella initiatives, do we need to pick up anything?
            - SDSA tasks?
        - Should we meet monthly, ad-hoc?
        - Align Trends
            - Example: microservices workshop idea, how to get into AI?
        - Ideas for collaborating around projects? Tech issues across xperts to collaborate on? Assignments for xperts, come up with a few projects? Where op for growth in different services areas, by xpert?

- Check xpert mtg notes from fadi
        - Come up with xpert vision, plan, agenda
            - VISION:
                    - Keep pulse and discuss and list tech trends
                    - Keep pulse on major focuses of Excella. Marry with tech trends.
                    - Personal focus - share our goals, initiatives, ask for feedback. Share approaches planned/doing, ask for feedback.
            - GENERAL AGENDA:
                    - Lightning talk on trends. PURPOSE: Everyone on the same page on broad trends.
                    - Go over the SDSA trello, look at our tasks, look at other tasks that xperts might tackle. PURPOSE: are we covering things Excella needs from xPerts?
                    - Each share their goals, current and planned initatives, and approaches. Feedback. Collaboration? PURPOSE: Get constructive feedback and open opportunities to collaborate (edited)
                    - WORKING SESSION?
                    - PURPOSE: xpert collaboration, aligning with Excella goals, keeping up with trends, keeping Fadi updated, working sessions
                        - I have seen many examples of meetings in person being more productive than remote, whiteboarding, talking etc. 
                        - keeping pulse: we do have inputs, such as Jeff's slide. CMS - absolutely we could influence that. 
                        - People absolutely want and should get more fb
                        - the group will totally influence the meeting as well, this is just a starting point.
                        - Excella wants more collab and tasks completed to completion from experts. Have they articulated it? That's our job to do from the overall Excella goals (i.e. cloud, containers)
                        - it would be so much easier and take less effort (other than commuting) to discuss, review and clarify Excella's goals, and align ourselves to it. Then brainstorm potential projects.
                            - "Xpert hackathon" -- a mandatory "happy hour" or dinner event where we set aside dedicated time to be in the same room working toward the SDSA objectives to ensure they get accomplishe
                        - Collab - not black or white; sometimes collab sometimes solo. Sometimes it makes sense to collab more than we do. 
                        - Trello for sure

#### Intreview notes, Chris Moon

Initiative
Not quite keeping up with the pace of the industry when it comes to learning new tech by trying it out. He didn't seem as excited to immerse himself in the software field which many have to do to keep up. 

Analytical Thinking
The code he wrote showed good analytical thinking, including catching some nuances. In talking through the code he was able to explain parts that we questioned well. 

Results oriented
He didn't have enough time in addition to the tech interviewing to get enough into this to gauge. He didn't mention any outcomes of projects or customer results. 

Flexible
He was open to different tech, however he didn't really get a good read on this.

Tech skill
For the number of years of experience, he didn't have very deep knowledge on most of the topics we tested him on. For example, he hadn't used an ORM, hadn't used CI tools or done automated testing, didn't know n-tier architecture, hashsets, generally didn't understand the why's of things and seemed like he just did things without full understanding.

Consulting Skills/Experience
He has been a consultant and he had decent problem-solving skills

Communication skills
He seemed to have solid communication skills, even if he wasn't communicating the right things to use per our questions.

Leadership Skills
He didn't discuss much here; he did have some team lead experience 

Ability to be part of a team
No problems here

Impact to business
He didn't describe his past work and experience in terms of impact.

Concerns
His level of knowledge based on his number of years of experience. He couldn't be considered a sr. dev with his knowledge but that is what he was expecting.
