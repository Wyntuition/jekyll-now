                - Communicate details of status a bit more, don't assume people just know things or that it would be just as fast to become aware over you telling. Communicate ideas a bit more before starting an initiative. People may have insights that help at that time, and it also fosters buy-in among the team members.
                - Diplomacy over calling out often works better when leading. Touchy responses can cause people to approch less.

    Brent Fuller - in person, leads by example, takes up a variety of tasks includnig scrum master, DevOps, process improvement analyst, etc. He reliably delivered things on time, and communicated what was necessary. Wants to lead people?
        - he knows the right thing to most effectively add value. He dives into the business domain, and bridges the tech/business gaps and prevents problems and reduces risk.

- Promotion
    - Want to lead people? How to be manager without that?
        - Discomfort consulting the client.
    - long hours
    - need more resume in leadership role. Sean took strong leadership traits to try and change how things how need to be - implementation not ideal but Sean was most involved in breaking down barriers to working differently, showed people a different way. Seth prob saw same issues, but got frustrated, quiet, stew about it, complain, didn't see himself as part of solution. Pat more on board with drastic changes for implementation/back to basics strategy but wasn't visionary -- this is where we need to go, set a course. 
    - unstanding that you need relationships with clients and people - expectation. Org awareness & ability to communicate

##### Appraisal notes, 3rd party, what to go on form

Seth contributed in a multitude of ways and roles in 2017, including as a senior developer, Scrum Master, tech lead, and xPert. Seth knew his client, NRECA, was pushing for go-live, so through pragmatic, smart and hard-working approaches, Seth was a key contributor to making this happen, while coaching his teammates, interfacing with the client, and relevant delivering xPert content such his talk Entity Framework Core, where he showcased Microsoft's new open-source ORM.

"Seth is intelligent, hard-working, professional, and a good teammate." At NRECA, Seth worked with developers coaching them technically, and with business analysts and stakeholders to analyze stories and provide feedback on scope and priorities.

Seth owned Billing requirements and techincal implementation, yielding a very critical, financially sensitive functionality successfully free of significant bugs.

His flexibility was stellar in dealing with a client hard to influence, resulting in long hours for extended periods, but being central in yielding a successful product in a crunched timeframe. This included having conversations with the client about deployments, hotfixes, etc. and he made sure to communicate clearly and often. 

Seth kept focus on allowing the product to go live, and after an intense and strategic effort, this happened successfully in the face of opposing odds. Seth stayed late into the evening for multiple days until the issues were resolved, knowing that he had to be flexible to resolve issues, even if the client was pushing for unreasonable results. Over a 3 day period, Seth logged 35.5 hours to run comparisons, fix defects, and answer questions.

The primary BA indicated that without Seth's in depth knowledge of the code and his analytical thinking, the resolution period would have been much longer. Thanks to Seth NRECA declared code freeze on schedule.

"Even as scrum master, Seth delivered story points. He led his team by being a good teammate."

After a tough road at NRECA, Seth was willing to switch stacks to join the myUSCIS team and fill a need there.

Among all of this, Seth lead getting the Tech Update newsletter up and running and then brought a team of editors up to speed to help and, eventually take over.





- One of the things that stood out about Seth to me was that he led by example.  For example, even though he had a lot of higher-level technical responsibilities and tasks, he did not forego all his sprint work and still contributed as a subject matter expert on more detailed development tasks."








Accountability

Seth put in long hours, reliably got tough techincal issues solved, owned responsibility for his team delivering, sometimes meaning long hours and/or tough conversations with stakeholders. Seth filled a plethora of roles necessary to get the complex NRECA project to completion, and always got his work done in a timely manner.

"I witnessed Seth push himself beyond the breaking point in the service of NRECA's go live, putting in crucial hours & skill to make sure that the operation would be a success."


Expertise

Seth grew as a technical expert and leader in 2017, on the client in many ways, and in xPert initatives with steady, quality output.

At NRECA, he contributed technical leadership in a variety of ways. He owned the Billing techincal solution and functionality, yielding a very critical, financially-sensitive product successfully. Seth served as the Technical Lead and Scrum Master for one of the development teams, where he looked after the technical output and their overall technical vision. He also managed a lot of the DevOps. Seth also enabled junior developers to be more productive with more quality work by coaching them.

His experise also reached into the business domain, where he became a go-to person because he could explaion techincal things in terms non-technical people could understand.

"Seth often picked up system issues and resolved them in a timely manner (e.g., TEST not working...build pipeline broken...upgrade to a new version of Visual Studio). He exhibited expertise both within the app and external to it."

"He had mastery of several domains and development best practices, and worked to instill these in other developers on the team. In a Scrummaster role, he was responsible for improving an entire team's delivery and he put in a lot of effort to do that."

Consider building on your current EF Core focus, by either going deeper with related projects, or wider with related components of things used with it like ASP.NET Core, various data stores it can work with or Azure (just examples). Also look into practicing and growing leadership skills learned from The Manager's Path and other resources (such as Radical Candor). This will complement technical leadership nicely. Practice approaching the client with technical questions or things to share with them, in order to increase your expertise and value to them.


Communication


He is also good at presenting technical knowledge. 

Planning and Execution 

Seth was able to produce xPert products while working an intense schedule to get the NRECA RS project live. The results were successes in both areas.


Teamwork

Mentor, coach, architect, analyst


Relationship Management

Seth took many opportunities to connect and build relationships with his teammates and stakeholds on NRECA in 2017, and is growing in this area. Seth had great relationships with his fellow developers. The junior developers looked up to him and learned a lot from his positive examples, appreciating that he is really is good natured and fun to be around. 

Seth appears to experience some discomfort with RM and consulting the client. He should try to build a stronger relationship with a client, for example more frequently communicating frustrations with the client and finding common ground. 



Therefore, this is more about client relationships. Try to be more sensitive to organizational awareness and taking it upon himself to talk things through when he doesn't agree with a decision, instead of making one-off disapproving remarks.

Seth should continue his work in the community, building himself as a subject matter expert in Entity Framework Core and the ecosystem around it.

    * Pat Leong

##### Appraisal



- proactive

- Eye for process - pivotal in restructuring the NRECA team. Try to see success beyond strict prescriptions of Scrum. 
- Champion of TDD, CI/CD, and clean code. Ultimately increased the quality of the RS product and helped lead to a successful release.

- communication
    - Always straightforward and willing and open to having tough conversations. 
    
    - Consider broader picture when approaching things that affect the whole project. The project has been heavily improved by Sean's work. The path there should be able to be smoothed out more and more as Sean gains experience and applies feedback from his initiatives. 
    - Consider ways to improve communication between non-developers in process of protecting developers.
        - Focus on reviewing his own work, asking the team how they feel about changes, and mold processes that fit the teaem instead of an ideal situation.
    - While interim results may have been less effective, he paved the way for the team to enter 2018 without fixed scope releases which has made for a very happy team." Enhanced the project significantly in the long run


- xPert activities strong, impressively as approaching production on NRECA.

- Sean's year overall was impressive, important and undenible. Sean has a lot of impact to give yet, as he grows his natural leadership and strategic abilities. His initiative, vision and attention to detail were big factors in the long-sought launch of RS.


Expertise

- Sean draws from a wealth of technical knowledge and is constantly learning. He built a technical roadmap with suggested system improvements which the client used as input to a strategic planning session at NRECA.
- He is a skilled developer and took on many of the large scale architectural tasks for RSP.

Communication

 - Sean's communication is excellent. His emails on production issues and the resolution left no questions unanswered. He documents well and makes a habit of writing down when something should be shared knowledge.
- Addresses everything in communications
- Very reliably keeps people updated
- Sean doesn't overlook anyone
- Extremely passionate

Team Leadership
he educated teammates and NRECA on Agile processes; he modeled expected behaviors for a functioning team; and he instilled discipline in team thought and action
- Should work on when to defer and when leading is most effective for everyone and the projecty
- Inspires team to be the best they can 

- Reach out proactively to other leaders, such as client and Excella leads, to foster more buy-in before pushing unilaterally. 
- Taking every action on himself for follow-up sometimes crosses into others' responsibility areas, may prevent opportunities for others and sets an example of overwork.
    - Takes on too much work

- I would advise Sean to make sure that he is aware of when to step out and let others take control. Sean has the ability to manage many different concepts but that could hurt him focus or take on larger initiatives if he continuously takes sole responsibility of smaller tasks.

- He also has pushed me very hard to improve rapidly. And it has genuinely made a huge difference."
- He is always there when I need a question answered. He always pings me to say hi, assures me my questions are important, always listens with a smile as long as I need to vent, always points me in the right direction."
- He’s also been a fierce advocate for my career as a developer. He’s pointed me to specific skills and projects and experiences he thinks I should learn or use or work on. 
- He encouraged me to figure out how to become a speaker at meetups and conferences. "

        QUARTERLY:
        - Brainstorm ideas: start with current trends, brainstorm projects/xpert work to do around them. Vote/etc.
        

        - 6 month plan, tie our own plans to overall xpert plan/Excella goal
            - Current business - get feedback. Collaboration. Updates from what paths people are going on? Balance b/t indiv. projects & collaboration. Review Excella initiatives, do we need to pick up anything?
            - SDSA tasks?
        - Should we meet monthly, ad-hoc?
        - Align Trends
            - Example: microservices workshop idea, how to get into AI?
        - Ideas for collaborating around projects? Tech issues across xperts to collaborate on? Assignments for xperts, come up with a few projects? Where op for growth in different services areas, by xpert?

- Check xpert mtg notes from fadi
        - Come up with xpert vision, plan, agenda
            - VISION:
                    - Keep pulse and discuss and list tech trends
                    - Keep pulse on major focuses of Excella. Marry with tech trends.
                    - Personal focus - share our goals, initiatives, ask for feedback. Share approaches planned/doing, ask for feedback.
            - GENERAL AGENDA:
                    - Lightning talk on trends. PURPOSE: Everyone on the same page on broad trends.
                    - Go over the SDSA trello, look at our tasks, look at other tasks that xperts might tackle. PURPOSE: are we covering things Excella needs from xPerts?
                    - Each share their goals, current and planned initatives, and approaches. Feedback. Collaboration? PURPOSE: Get constructive feedback and open opportunities to collaborate (edited)
                    - WORKING SESSION?
                    - PURPOSE: xpert collaboration, aligning with Excella goals, keeping up with trends, keeping Fadi updated, working sessions
                        - I have seen many examples of meetings in person being more productive than remote, whiteboarding, talking etc. 
                        - keeping pulse: we do have inputs, such as Jeff's slide. CMS - absolutely we could influence that. 
                        - People absolutely want and should get more fb
                        - the group will totally influence the meeting as well, this is just a starting point.
                        - Excella wants more collab and tasks completed to completion from experts. Have they articulated it? That's our job to do from the overall Excella goals (i.e. cloud, containers)
                        - it would be so much easier and take less effort (other than commuting) to discuss, review and clarify Excella's goals, and align ourselves to it. Then brainstorm potential projects.
                            - "Xpert hackathon" -- a mandatory "happy hour" or dinner event where we set aside dedicated time to be in the same room working toward the SDSA objectives to ensure they get accomplishe
                        - Collab - not black or white; sometimes collab sometimes solo. Sometimes it makes sense to collab more than we do. 
                        - Trello for sure
    

Fadi, 1/18/18
