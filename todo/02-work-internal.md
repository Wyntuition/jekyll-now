            - J
                - Communicate details of status a bit more, don't assume people just know things or that it would be just as fast to become aware over you telling. Communicate ideas a bit more before starting an initiative. People may have insights that help at that time, and it also fosters buy-in among the team members.
                - Diplomacy over calling out often works better when leading. Touchy responses can cause people to approch less.


- update PD policy? (linked from appraisal) https://excellaco.sharepoint.com/internal/HR/teamsite/Excella%20Employee%20Guide/Professional%20Development.aspx

Accountability

Expertise
Serves as a resource for task execution and/or troubleshooting efforts that require skills to address tasks and issues.

React learning, with best practices. It hasn't been too much time with React, keep going deep to get the most effective and translatable learning. Expand REST expertise to complimentary tech such as cloud (i.e. deploying APIs on cloud, using serverless).

Effective communication of test mocking/stubbing/etc across multiple teams.

-+ test strategy; balance of unit tests, other tests and manual

Attitude
"He works well with others and brings a strong work ethic and a positive attitude to the table"

- Dives deep into certain areas that have benefitted the team as a whole with documentation

"Related to picking up new technologies, Glenn has an obvious thirst for self-improvement and learning, which he has made a part of the culture of his team"

- Initiative to fix problem with a DevOps bottlneck

- Keep trying to apply best practices more and more; implementation patterns keep coming up

#### Seth

Appraisal, 1/2018
- 3rd party feedback:
    Pat Leong
    Sean Killeen
    Waleed Ershad
    Sam Blissard
    Joan Nelson
    Starr Chen
    Brent Fuller - in person, leads by example, takes up a variety of tasks includnig scrum master, DevOps, process improvement analyst, etc. He reliably delivered things on time, and communicated what was necessary. Wants to lead people?
        - he knows the right thing to most effectively add value. He dives into the business domain, and bridges the tech/business gaps and prevents problems and reduces risk.

- Promotion
    - Want to lead people? How to be manager without that?
        - Discomfort consulting the client.
    - long hours
    - need more resume in leadership role. Sean took strong leadership traits to try and change how things how need to be - implementation not ideal but Sean was most involved in breaking down barriers to working differently, showed people a different way. Seth prob saw same issues, but got frustrated, quiet, stew about it, complain, didn't see himself as part of solution. Pat more on board with drastic changes for implementation/back to basics strategy but wasn't visionary -- this is where we need to go, set a course. 
    - unstanding that you need relationships with clients and people - expectation. Org awareness & ability to communicate



2/6/18 Meeting with Reena & Suzanne

?'s 
    - What opportunities do you have there as a leader to the project?
        - *Story break-down, architecture, best practices, standards
            - Own/be accountable for an area
            - Lang. barrier should not prevent you from these things
        - Reaching out to Suzanne, Reena, other devs, pairing?
        - You'll naturally be a role model to devs, must lead
         -*Regular mentoring?
         -* ask questions any type, create safe culture
         -*** what other path is not wanting to lead people?
    - *Overwhelmed?
    - How is the ramp-up with the new stack?
        - *TIME IT TAKES
    - *Pairing enough, story production, use xpert time? Getting resources you need?
    - How can Suzanne help?
     -*COMMUNICATION: practice, not proactive in updating statues, 
        - *MORE PROAVTIVE
        - *Err on OVERCOMM
    -* DEV PLAN
    - ** Suzanne in appraisal?

2/7/18 Meeting with Seth

- Could use a detailed architectural review, now with some context
- Hard to understand right ways when there is a evolution of Rails approahces

- Overwhelmed by learning new business domain, and stack, and logistics

Appraisal, 1.2018
- 3rd
    * Pat Leong
    * Seth Puckett
    * Joan Nelson
        -  his actions can at times be boundless, crossing into other's responsibility area. This mindset also leads to a lack of delegation for enabling team member growth.
    * Brendan Sawyer
    * Gabriel Diaz
    * Dan Stalcup

- lead NRECA strategicly to improve deeply and long term
- grew and guided people
-? exemplery on tech skills? Ask Seth.

- Very competant; thinks of lot of ideas, handles a lot, very efficient, thinks like a leader
    - needs to work on things, but has done tons of broad things, proposals/BD, connections, Riccardo brought on
    - for managing, you take on feeling of ownership of Excella's success -> pretty much doing that.

+S, 1/23/18
- No CMS
Career path
    - Env for entrepreneurial attitude; partnerships in creating value for org; involved in whole lifecycle

        +++xperts to manage; open to any stack

Went over this: 
[FIRST/PERODIC]

## xpert meeting notes


xpert notes:

- xpert agenda send out, discussions with themes (i.e. 6 month plan, upcoming themes & trends, personal project)
    - Clear outcomes.
        - Review our progress
        - Share our work in progress & ideas for upcoming work
        - Review SDSA trello
        - Review industry trends and Excella initiatives and how we can align

        QUARTERLY:
        - Brainstorm ideas: start with current trends, brainstorm projects/xpert work to do around them. Vote/etc.
        

        - 6 month plan, tie our own plans to overall xpert plan/Excella goal
            - Current business - get feedback. Collaboration. Updates from what paths people are going on? Balance b/t indiv. projects & collaboration. Review Excella initiatives, do we need to pick up anything?
            - SDSA tasks?
        - Should we meet monthly, ad-hoc?
        - Align Trends
            - Example: microservices workshop idea, how to get into AI?
        - Ideas for collaborating around projects? Tech issues across xperts to collaborate on? Assignments for xperts, come up with a few projects? Where op for growth in different services areas, by xpert?

- Check xpert mtg notes from fadi
        - Come up with xpert vision, plan, agenda
            - VISION:
                    - Keep pulse and discuss and list tech trends
                    - Keep pulse on major focuses of Excella. Marry with tech trends.
                    - Personal focus - share our goals, initiatives, ask for feedback. Share approaches planned/doing, ask for feedback.
            - GENERAL AGENDA:
                    - Lightning talk on trends. PURPOSE: Everyone on the same page on broad trends.
                    - Go over the SDSA trello, look at our tasks, look at other tasks that xperts might tackle. PURPOSE: are we covering things Excella needs from xPerts?
                    - Each share their goals, current and planned initatives, and approaches. Feedback. Collaboration? PURPOSE: Get constructive feedback and open opportunities to collaborate (edited)
                    - WORKING SESSION?
                    - PURPOSE: xpert collaboration, aligning with Excella goals, keeping up with trends, keeping Fadi updated, working sessions
                        - I have seen many examples of meetings in person being more productive than remote, whiteboarding, talking etc. 
                        - keeping pulse: we do have inputs, such as Jeff's slide. CMS - absolutely we could influence that. 
                        - People absolutely want and should get more fb
                        - the group will totally influence the meeting as well, this is just a starting point.
                        - Excella wants more collab and tasks completed to completion from experts. Have they articulated it? That's our job to do from the overall Excella goals (i.e. cloud, containers)
                        - it would be so much easier and take less effort (other than commuting) to discuss, review and clarify Excella's goals, and align ourselves to it. Then brainstorm potential projects.
                            - "Xpert hackathon" -- a mandatory "happy hour" or dinner event where we set aside dedicated time to be in the same room working toward the SDSA objectives to ensure they get accomplishe
                        - Collab - not black or white; sometimes collab sometimes solo. Sometimes it makes sense to collab more than we do. 
                        - Trello for sure
    

Fadi, 1/18/18
