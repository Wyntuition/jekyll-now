# Goals for 2018

- Example microservices - Ruby, Python; (Chirs); different SA's build their MS in their stack.
    - ? - what solution for microservies app?
    + - Blog - something my stack excels at
- INTERNAL HACKATHON FOR OS IDEAS (Chris)
- Case studies (verification, myUSIS, etc; reusable content) (Chris)
- Excella Central
- .net new stuff, WS/training, .NET radar updated
- JS tech radar
- Chatbot (DU)
- Java showcase, radar (Cici)


SUMAMRY:

Continue focusing on going deep into containers and outputting workshop, tutorial and presentation artifacts. Expand into a deployment workshop, as this is the logical next step with a lot of demand and need.

Supplement containers with related microservices and cloud material, including blogs on getting started with & determining the need for microservices. Supplement that with microservices tutorials and deployment contant from there into AWS and/or Azure.

- Containers
- Microservices overview, getting started with building, and determining if needed
- Deploying to AWS/Azure

## 3 months: Further myself as a Docker thought leader by offering the level 1 workshop more, and add a deployment workshop to the series.

    - Getting Started Docker Workshop for USCIS, to fill in gaps and ramp up (3)
    - Docker Workshop Series: Getting Started with Docker Workshop, at meetup (8)
    - Docker Workshop Series: Getting Started with Deployment Workshop, at meetup (8)
    - Presentation: Container Orchestration Overview (5)
    - Presentation: Container Orchestration in Azure at NoVA Code Camp (8)

## 6 months: Supplement containers with microservices blog(s), BD cheat sheet(s), and sample app(s).

    - Microservices BD cheatsheet - when to bring up microservices, how to respond to questions, what questions to ask, related tech, etc. (5?)
    - Getting started with microservices, Should I be using microservices blogs (3-6)
    - Sandbox open-source Labs project - build a few microservices working together on different tech stacks, into a orchestrated deployment environment (5)
    - Supervisor for 3 Excellians (24)
    - Presentation at CMAP .NET User Group (5)

## 1 year: Focus on AWS, Azure and CI/CD technologies to complement containers, creating a working sandbox showcasing these technologies and approaches.

    - Expand microservices sandbox into AWS or Azure (5-10)
    - Tutorial documentation around creating and deploying microservices (5-10)
