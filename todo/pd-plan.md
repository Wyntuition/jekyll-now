## Plan - Current

- ORG PD. This should be on PD plan regularly reviewed
- Katas:
    - Functional, JS, Python, algo

    - CS computational-related theory
    - AI
        - ML testing 
    - python programming, dist. computing, infra
    - proper architecture? test exercises?
    - DevOps:
        - Containers:
            - Orchestration: Kube, vs. others
