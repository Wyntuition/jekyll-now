## TASKS

### Now


1

Care personally

- personal motivation (picnic, vodka); GIVE A DAMN!
    - regular lunch; real care for people (would help our families)

    - "Get it professional" doesn't recognize we are human and have feelings; alienates.
        - Ok to show feelings
        - people will feel uncomfortable going to work
        - Bring whole self instead. BAGGAGE??
        - *CREATE SAFE SPACE. Show vunerability to reports (I.e. or just say you're having a bad day)
        - Some people feel superior when becoming boss - angers people.
            - avoid term employee
            - *no use in pretending no hierarchy
    - *Have to care for whole person
        - doing things you already know how to do. Ackknowledge we are all people with aspiration
        - make time for real convos
        - find out what's important to people; what they disike; share about yourself
        - *care deepely about people in general, while being prepared to be hated in return


Challange directly - second component of radical candor

- Great work, and builds great relationships
    - human errors are correctly by experience and discussion, not experience alone
    - shows you care enough to point out things not going well, commited to fixing mistakes, admitting mistakes. Embraces conflict instead of avoiding it.
    - *If no one is ever mad at you, you're not challanging team enough (being responsible means sometimes pissing people off)
        - key is how you handle anger. Acknowledge other person's pain.
        - *eliminate phrase "don't take it personally" - insulting. Address problem.
    -> Care personally while challanging directly - builds best relationships of career
    - *Hardest part at first. Might have to critize work while still establishing relationship. But hardesst part is actually inviting people to challange you directly.
        - takes getting used to, but you'll learn a lot about yourself, team
    - *don't nitpick; rule of thumb: leave 3 things unsaid a day
    - *need to practice rad. candor up, down and sideways. If can't in work environment, find another one.
    - must adapt rad. candor style from person to person, company to company, country to country
- *Get people to want to be challanged?


Part II Tools and Techniques
5 relationships

- too much emplesis on shareholder value destroys value and morale
- must be centered, relationships strong = shareholder value, not start
- Inside out
    - work/life integration (not balance as one robs the other). Time at work can be an expression of who you are and feed your general life.
    - prioritize doing centering activities as you need (i.e. sleep 8 hours, meals w/families)
    - Calendar - put commute on calender etc to ensure accounted for
    - give team sense of autonomy so they bring best selves to work
        - relinquish unilateral authority; can't get above with power, auth, control
        - authority derives from merit
        ***chap 5 12:20
        - 360 & cross team analysis in promotions, decided by committee. Prevents favs.
        - *How lay down unilateral auth?
- *master art of socailzing at work; don't rely on outside events. Meet families etc, but don't force it!
- respect boundaries

6 Guidance 

-* how distinguish b/t constructive fb & insults
    - measured by other person's ear, not your mouth
    -**Do in person, so reactions are visible. You can understand whether you want to move out on the care personally axis.
    - if they get upset doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. Must react w/compassion, no magic words
-FB IN 1 TO 1'S
 lot of people in the tech industry keep everything for the 1:1. The weekly 1:1 is where everything is going to be solved. Do you think that’s a mistake to store up all the feedback and issues?

Kim: It’s a huge mistake. If you’re a manager and you have an employee, it’s the other person who gets to set the 1:1 agenda. Your job as a manager in a 1:1 is to listen to the other person, so saving up feedback for a 1:1 is going to do a bunch of bad things. First of all, you’re not in listening mode if you have a list of things you need to say. Second, a good use of feedback in a 1:1 is to solicit it, not to give it. Third, if you use your 1:1 time as the only opportunity to give feedback, you introduce such artificiality into the whole feedback process

-* creating a culture of feedback
    - earn right to give fb by soliticing it

    four things that I recommend you do when soliciting feedback. You should do this with your boss, your employees, and your peers. You can even try it with your spouse. The first is to come up with a go-to question. For the same reason that you’re reluctant to give feedback, the other person is reluctant to give you feedback and so it’s really important that you come up with a question that falls trippingly off your tongue, that you’re comfortable asking.

    I’ll give you two examples. My go-to question is, “Is there anything that I could do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?” I was talking to a friend of mine, Christa Quarles, CEO at OpenTable, and she said, “I could never ask that question. It would feel so artificial for me. The question that I like to ask people is, ‘Here’s what I think. Tell me why I’m smoking crack.’” Whatever question works for you, use it, but come up with something you can ask.

    You earn the right to give feedback by soliciting it.
    Step number two is to embrace the discomfort. Remember, the person doesn’t want to give you any feedback, so the best way for you to get them to say something is to embrace the discomfort. It’s tempting to feel like, “If I make you comfortable you’ll tell me the truth,” but the thing that’s going to make the other person comfortable is to let them off the hook and say, “Oh, everything’s fine.” You can’t do that.

    A simple technique for embracing the discomfort is to shut your mouth and count to six in your head. Six is a long time. If you count to six in your head, the other person will say something just to break the silence because most people can’t endure six seconds of silence. Having shut up for six seconds, which is hard, the person’s going to tell you something. When they say something, it’s really important not to react defensively.

    Step number three is to listen with the intent to understand, not to respond to the person. Having done that, your fourth step is then to reward the candor. Now, it’s easy to reward the candor if you agree with the feedback. You fix the problem and you tell the person that you fixed the problem. But it’s hard if you disagree with the feedback.

    Feedback is a two-way street. You don’t have to agree with all of it. This is not a, “Thank you, sir. May I have another?” situation. If you disagree with the feedback, the thing that I recommend is to find that 5% of what they said that you can agree with, wait a day or two so you’re sure you’re not in a defensive frame of mind, and then explain to them why you disagree. Sometimes the only reward you have to offer is a fuller explanation of your point of view.


- *How to give praise 

    John: A lot of people have problems praising people who work with them or for them. Is it that people are afraid to patronize their teammates? Why do you think people struggle there?

    Kim: A lot of people struggle with praise because praise can feel arrogant. Like, “Who am I to judge what’s good and bad?” Another common trend is they’re afraid that if they praise somebody they will cause them to rest on their laurels. The thing to keep in mind here is that praise, when it’s really specific, doesn’t cause people to rest on their laurels. It teaches them what to keep doing. It’s guidance. If you think about it not as feedback but as guidance, praise lets them know when they’re going in the right direction; criticism lets them know when they’re going in the wrong direction.

    It’s not merely positive reinforcement. It’s letting not just that individual but, if you praise in public, the whole team know what success looks and feels. Sometimes people do something and they don’t know whether it’s good or bad, and they can’t know unless you tell them. It’s important for that reason.

    Another reason people are reluctant to praise is that it often feels insincere. So many people have been taught to give the so-called feedback sandwich, which is say something nice, then give the criticism, and then say something nice again. Don’t give the feedback sandwich. Make sure that when you give people praise, it’s sincere, that you really mean it.
