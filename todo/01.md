## TASKS

### Today/Near Timely
*R* Regs above (GO THRU FULLY SOMETIME)
*I* !!! DOCKER presentation; WORKSHOP increment, promote; scala [I]
*I* car pros/cons, niche & topic exploration

- book dockercon

- Docker SG 1

* Containers from 30,000 feet
* Windows vs Linux
* Docker
* Kubernetes - leading orchestrator, needed for managing deployment and running apps
* Docker Engine - plumbing that runs and orchestrates containers
* EE vs CE
* Moby - tools that combine to make Docker daemon. Breaks dDOcekr into modular components. Big infra contributors. Golang.
    * Batteries included but removable
* Open Container Initiative (OCI) - standardized image format and container runtime
* Installing Docker: Windows, Mac, Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu, Docker EE, etc
* Upgrading Docker: 
    - make sure containers have restart policy, 
    - drain nodes if needed (using Swarm mode). 
    - Steps: 
        - Stop Docker daemon, remove old version, install new version, configure new version to auto start when system boots, ensure containers restarted.
* Docker and storage drivers
    - Every Docker container gets an area of local storage where image layers are stacked and the container filesystem is mounted. By default this is where all container read/write ops occur, making it integral to the perf and stability of every container.
    - Local storage area has been managed by storage driver, which are sometiomes called the graph driver. Docker supports several different storage drivers, each which implements layering and copy-on-write in its own way - impacting perf and stability.
        - Some available drivers:
            - aufs (the original and oldest)
            - overlay2 (probably best choice for future)
            - devicemapper
            - btrfs
            - zfs
        - Windows only supports overlay2
* DevOps perspective
    - Ops - 
        - Docker client, 
        - daemon/engine, 
        - images, running containers
        - attaching to running containers
        - Dev perspective


    
    


CLEAN

+ pros Quay includes automated geographic replication, integrated security scanning with Clair, image time machine for viewing history, performs rollbacks and automated pruning, and more.

Instead of deploying containers individually, you always deploy and operate on a pod of containers. The key thing about pods is that when a pod does contain multiple containers, all of them are always run on a single worker node. Container grouping, closely related, almost as if in same container. all containers of a pod share the same set of Linux namespaces instead of each container having its own set (Network and UTS namespaces, IPC ) so they all share the same hostname and network interfaces, share IP, port space, loopback so localhost - a flat, inter pod network. Communication between pods is thus simple. Make pods more like vms having related processes running together. Basic unit of scaling. Only subprocesses should share pod with other containers like side car (ie log rotator, file sync)    

What does a container cluster look like, with agents, ee features etc.        

Circle of abstractions (apps, pods, containers, vms, ...).        

***kube resources are usually a posting a JSON or YAML manifest to the Kubernetes REST. Generate from pod.

Diagram showing general container management. Abstractions to manage different aspects.      Birds eye of cloud architecture, cloud patterns



1. To finish setting up your cluster, run:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```


1. See the resilience provided by the deployment, which will keep the number of replicas requested.

    1. In one terminal, run: `kubectl get pods -w`

    1. Watch the output of that while running this in another terminal: `kubectl delete pod pingpong-xxxx` filling in `xxxx` with a pod identifier.
