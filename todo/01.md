what Microsoft buying github means 

Microsoft wants to be seen to developers as compelling and "cool" as other platforms, like Ruby on Rails or NodeJS. Part of thier new business model is Azure growth, and a diverse developer ecosystem is an important part of that.

Microsoft will use its sales channels to get GitHub into more enterprises that don't have it. 

It will be offered as a service in Microsoft's cloud surely. How about others?
