# Goals for 2018

SUMAMRY:

Continue focusing on going deep into containers and outputting workshop, tutorial and presentation artifacts. Expand into a deployment workshop, as this is the logical next step with a lot of demand and need.

Supplement containers with related microservices and cloud material, including blogs on getting started with & determining the need for microservices. Supplement that with microservices tutorials and deployment contant from there into AWS and/or Azure.

- Containers
- Microservices overview, getting started with building, and determining if needed
- Deploying to AWS/Azure via Kubenetes; Doguhan on other hosts, Pat on Kube
- (o) ML

## 6 months: Supplement containers with microservices blog(s), BD cheat sheet(s), and sample app(s).
