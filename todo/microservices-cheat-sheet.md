# Microservices Cheat Sheet

Microservices promise many benefits that are of interest to application architects and development teams, including fluid, flexible delivery of changes, implementation technology flexibility, precise scalability and cloud readiness.

## Archiectural Choices

- SPECTRUM: Monolith ... hybrid services ...  microservices
- Most organisations will find microservices too complex, expensive and disruptive to deliver a return on the investment required. 
- Meanwhile, organisations can derive tremendous value from the miniservices model, which advocates a more pragmatic, coarse-grained services approach with relaxed architectural constraints. 

## Benefits

## Drawbacks

## Examples of where to do it

- Most volitile areas, most needing of scaling and agile delivery

## Options of approaches


## Questions to Ask

- What is the nature and size of your software project? 

Q: What is the experience level of your team(s)?

A: 

- Determine whether your organisation is mature enough to adopt microservices. Do you have a strong application architecture practice? Do you have a mature agile and DevOps practice? Will your data management team support it?

  - Use in cloud?
  - Lift and shift?
  - on-prem?


  Getting Started
  
  - Take it slowly. Initially use microservices only where you need to — in applications with web-scale agility or scalability requirements. Direct teams to experiment with the new patterns and technologies and build expertise.
  - Expect to implement a microservices infrastructure to provide the outer architecture capabilities needed to build, deploy and operate fleets of microservices. PaaS and container management platforms can provide a core, but you’ll need to supplement this with capabilities such as API gateways, service discovery, monitoring and telemetry, build and test automation, messaging and data persistence.
