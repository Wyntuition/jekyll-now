I'll caveat I am not an auth expert so there may be some inaccuracies here but hopefully the gist is right. OAuth 1.0 handles authorization & authentication but it's old. OAuth 2 only tries to tackle authorization, which is appropriate sometimes when you don't need authentication but just authorization (i.e. b/t internal resources which would be relevant to us). A lot of people use OAuth2 for both authentication and authorization which which makes things less secure and more confusing. OpenID Connect tries to provide a reasonable for both by combining OAuth 2 and OpenID, and it seems to be the current standard.  On my last project just using OAuth (2 actually I think), we had to do some hacky things in order to authenticate for external users in some cases. I.E. it wasn't always easy to limit access for their bearer token to very specific servers.
