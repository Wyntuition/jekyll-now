===TODAY-USCIS===
- stab at stories, review. Notes from plan mtg.
- docker meeting sch; brain dump; jenkins local, run by folks before brown bagging
- pipeline config - run on checkin, refresh index
-mtg for us, then with EV to see when we can test in 
- NEXT STEPS - what is 27 transaction views VQ did? 3 updates with mod data. In-app reports:23, ERD diagrams?, why SVS in CP mapping? What are EPLs?
    -+start seeing feasibility from running full transformations - actually convert legacy cases into mod. Views 2nd priority.
    -+scope?! End of Dec for Mod schema, then more from gap analysis. In-app reports priority for views. Find major diff b/t mod and leg.
    -*TOP PRI:ESTIMATE FOR THESE: 
        1. Test app, find out what we don't know about making it prod ready. % case failure; case closure reason code error. 
        2. pri, in app reporting.
        -?* EV team have end-to-end app tests?
    

===USVIS ===
    - Docker in Pipeline. PR branches.

# Provide a GitHub access token for pulling data files from eve-data. The app looks for it in <HOME DIRECTORY>/.gitaccesstoken, so you can run this command to create it:

$ echo <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN> > ${HOME}/.gitaccesstoken

===TODAY===
!-

- [ ] photos to Bob
- [ ] qcon blog (org main todo)
    - [ ] TODO's (plus gTodos)
    - [ ] clean up hub; find way to sync to uscis & mobile
