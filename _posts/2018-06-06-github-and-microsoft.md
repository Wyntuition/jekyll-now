# The Future of GitHub at Microsoft

What does Microsoft have in mind this acquisition of GitHub?

## Tools to the cloud

For one, they have historically made money off selling products and tooling.  Microsoft will use its sales channels to get GitHub into more enterprises that don't have it. It will be offered as a service in Microsoft's cloud surely. A natual question is would an AWS offer GitHub-as-a-service.

## New developer audiences

Microsoft wants their new development platform (.NET Core) to be seen to developers as compelling and "cool" as other platforms, like Ruby on Rails or NodeJS. Historically, the .NET ecosystem was an outlier compared to others, running on Windows and using Windows tooling, and all the rest used more similar Linux tooling. They already have embraced open source and written their new web framework with open source, so it's an option for all developers instead of just Windows/.NET developers. They want their open source .NET Core platform to be considered amongst Ruby, NodeJs, Python, and others.

Part of their new business model is Azure growth, and a diverse developer ecosystem is an important part of that. The more people using Microsoft development tools, the more opportunities they get to help people deploy into Azure with hooks in the tooling. This includes a marketplace which they might offer in GibHub, where you could buy cloud services from any provider including Azure, right there.

## One-stop development shop

Microsoft wants to make GitHub a central spot for coding, building, optimizing, deploying to (any) cloud, monitoring, QA, Planning, Docs/collab.

GitHub Marketplace - you'll be able to buy cloud services from any provider.

VS Code integration making it a one-stop cross-platform toolset. It will also have rich integration with GitHub allowing things like PR review to be done without going to the website.

They are envisioning a single toolset for developing & deploying on any platform with VS Code & GitHub, and a Github marketplace. You could buy and use cloud services like Enterprise Jenkins (CloudBees) and Azure right in Github.

    Sacha Labourey, CEO of CloudBees, (enterprise Jenkins) "can't think of a better destination for GitHub than 'The New Microsoft.'"

## Conclusion

There is some backlash in the developer community, such as those who don't want a large corporation control their source code, and among hobbiests who don't want to be part of the Microsoft ecosystem. Outside of that, Microsoft sees the need to jolt their statue as a software development tools & services vendor, and it plays into hopeful future Azure revenue in various ways, from a larger developer ecosystem using their tools thus maybe paying for something, and maybe deploying something into Azure.
