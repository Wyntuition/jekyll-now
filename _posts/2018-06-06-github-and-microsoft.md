# The Future of GitHub at Microsoft

What does Microsoft have in mind this acquisition of GitHub? It certainly has raised a lot of eyebrows and concerns.

## Tools to the cloud

For one, they have historically made money off selling products and tooling.  Microsoft will use its sales channels to get GitHub into more enterprises that don't have it. It will be offered as a service in Microsoft's cloud surely. A natural question is, would an AWS offer GitHub-as-a-service from Microsoft.

## New developer audiences

Microsoft wants their new development platform (.NET Core) to be seen as compelling and "cool" as other platforms, like Ruby on Rails or NodeJS. Historically, the .NET ecosystem was an outlier compared to others, running on Windows and using Windows tooling, and all the rest used Linux tooling, more standard across stacks. Microsoft has already have embraced open source and written their new web framework with open source, so it's a viable option for all developers instead of just Windows/.NET developers. They want their open source .NET Core platform to be considered amongst Ruby, NodeJs, Python, and others.

Part of their new business model is Azure growth, and a diverse developer ecosystem is an important part of that. The more people using Microsoft development tools, the more opportunities they get to help people deploy into Azure with hooks in the tooling. This includes an enhanced marketplace which they might offer in GitHub, where you could buy cloud services from any provider including Azure, right there.

## One-stop development shop

One way Microsoft could draw a larger audience is by following through with their vision of making GitHub a central spot for coding, building, optimizing, deploying to (any) cloud, monitoring, QA, planning, docs/collab. If they jolt GitHub Marketplace, that'll make the path to cloud deployments easier.

Deep VS Code integration with GibHib could make it a one-stop cross-platform toolset. It could have integrations allowing things like PR review to be done without going to the website.

They envision a single toolset for developing & deploying using any platform, with VS Code, GitHub and a Github marketplace. You could buy and use cloud services like Enterprise Jenkins (CloudBees) and Azure right in Github. Some are excited about this vision such as Sacha Labourey, CEO of CloudBees, (enterprise Jenkins) who said he "can't think of a better destination for GitHub than 'The New Microsoft.'"

## Conclusion

There is some backlash in the developer community, such as those who don't want a large corporation controlling their source code, and among hobbyists who don't want to be part of the Microsoft ecosystem. Outside of that, Microsoft sees the need to jolt their statue as a software development tools & services vendor, and it plays into hopeful future Azure revenue in various ways, from a larger developer ecosystem using their tools thus maybe paying for something, and maybe deploying something into Azure.
