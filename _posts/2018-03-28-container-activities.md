## Managing Modern Software: An Overview of Container Management [presentation]

[PPT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzVVFi4AfziiMHVZdFVTMHpzSk0)

In accelerating software delivery at your organization, you've likely done a lot of work with DevOps, and in the process may have had interaction with containers in some way, whether it's using them locally to build or try something, or deploying software in them into the cloud, or hearing your IT executives pushing for cost savings via containerizing things. Containers are an exciting technology that allows DevOps practices to make software delivery even more efficient in many ways, from cost savings to more frequent delivery.

As you get deeper into containers, you'll get deeper into container management needs. As soon as you have a set of containers deployed in production, you quickly find the need to manage things, everything from how the containers will find each other out in the wild, to what happens when they crash:

* Scheduling - deploying containers on the right infrastructure depending on capacity, etc.
* Container-to-container communication & service discovery 
* Scaling
* Load balancing
* Self-healing (automatic restarts)
* Rolling updates
* Service/App management (organizing containers that comprise an application; managing deployments)
* Storage management

You probably have heard buzz words like Kubernetes, which provides functionality like these and much more, but the ecosystem overall is daunting at first. This presentation will summarize the ecosystem, giving an overview of what container management and orchestration is, and will look at some tools, including Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos.

Attendees should come away with a clearer understanding of container management, why you need it, and what tools are out there. Additionally they will come out with actionable next steps in container management.

Comments: I am a seasoned speaker with technical depth and experience in these hot container topics, and I have helped clarify the container management ecosystem for clients and co-workers. This is a hot topic I am excited to help people understand better.

## Business Case for Microservices

## Cloud, Containers and Microservices, what's the deal? An Overview of Cloud Infrastructure

All of us in the IT industry are hearing words like containers, cloud, microservices, serverless and more. For IT decision makers who aren't able to get into the weeds of these things on a regular basis may have some trouble sorting out what all of these things are and how they relate.

## Container Deployment Workshop

Many of us have come into interaction with container, otherwise know it is inevitable. Many may have also noticed that things get complicated when you start to explore deployment options for containers. Getting your hands dirty as soon as possible by deploying a containerized application will demystify a lot of things quickly and allow you to move forward faster. 

In this 2-hour workshop, we will take an existing simple app that is running in Docker, and go through steps to deploy it to Kubernetes. 

Audience Skill Level: practical hands-on experience and understanding of Docker (we won't have time to go over Docker concepts)

## Getting Started with Docker (Docker for Development) Workshop

This is a 2-hour workshop - hands-on - on getting started with Docker for software development.

Audience Skill Level: Those of all skill levels new to Docker

Requirements: attendees must bring laptops, charged (may not be enough plugs), and with Docker installed & working (shouldn't take more than 5-10 mins):

• Install & set up for Windows (https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows?tab=description)

• Install & set up for Mac (https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac?tab=description)

Why Docker?

Using Docker during the development process has several advantages. We can use or create a container that has the libraries and tools we need for our app - we don’t have them on our host computer. We can spin up an environment with multiple services (including a database) in minutes, with one command. We can then share this environment with our teammates so we can ensure they have the same versions of things installed and can get up and running quickly.

Agenda Details

• Basics of Docker and containers

• Run an existing image

• Create an image, and tweak it in order to get the dependencies we need to start a container for developing

• Use Compose to spin up a development environment with a database

#### Part I

Join us for part 1 of 2 of our Getting Into Docker Workshop Series, where we will take an existing simple app and Dockerize it. The workshop will begin with a 20-minute overview of the concepts run through the concepts of Docker before we jump into Dockerizing an app, then using Compose to build and run it.

// Set up before the Event //
Docker installed in working (5-10 minutes)

// Requirements //
Open to all skill levels. Attendees must bring laptops, charged (may not be enough plugs), and with Docker installed & working (shouldn't take more than 5-10 mins)

#### Part II

Join us for part 2 of 2  of the Getting Into Docker Workshop Series, where we will take the containerized app from our first workshop session and deploy it.

// Set up before the Event //
Docker installed & working

// Requirements //
Practical hands-on experience and understanding of Docker (we won’t have time to go over Docker concepts). The Getting Started with Docker Workshop is a great prerequisite. 

Attendees must bring laptops, charged (may not be enough plugs), and with Docker installed & working (shouldn't take more than 5-10 mins)
